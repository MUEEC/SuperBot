NB:
Run MIC5378YC5 pcb part by Tom
	- Had trouble with the component generator 2d part so I custom did it
Programming via arduino interface?
	- Seems to be possible? Allows use of arduino IDE and language which is good for beginners
how to pull IO0 low for programming with USB-UART conv.
	- IO0 needs to be pulled low for programming mode
	- There seems to be a circuit for this in the example schematic but I'm not sure I understand it
	- Example schematic: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/ESP32-Core-Board-V2_sch.pdf
		- Look in bottom left corner
LEDS - single resistor possible?
	- Don't think so sadly
JST and wire connectors for battery and range finders
	- Max 5-6 amps from the battery so need wire for that (AWG 21 or lower I think)
Range finder placement and housing
	- Need angle brackets so they can face forward not up.
	- For all 3 sensors I think.
